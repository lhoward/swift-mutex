# Introduction

**AllocatedLock** is a lightweight cross platform lock with an API compatible with [`OSAllocatedUnfairLock`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/osallocatedunfairlock) available in macOS Ventura, iOS 16 and later.  The lock wraps [`os_unfair_lock_t`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/os_unfair_lock_t) on Darwin platforms and [`pthread_mutex_t`](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?pthread_mutex_lock(3)) on Linux.

# Installation

AllocatedLock can be installed by using Swift Package Manager.

 **Note:** AllocatedLock requires Swift 5.7 on Xcode 14+. It runs on iOS 13+, tvOS 13+, macOS 10.15+, Linux and Windows.
To install using Swift Package Manager, add this to the `dependencies:` section in your Package.swift file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/swhitty/AllocatedLock.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.2"))
```

# Usage

Usage is similar with [`OSAllocatedUnfairLock`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/osallocatedunfairlock).

The recommended usage to create a lock that protects some state:
```swift
let state = AllocatedLock<Int>(initialState: 0)
```

Use `.withLock` to acquire the lock to read the state:
```swift
let val = state.withLock { $0 }
```

Or mutate the state
```swift
let val = state.withLock { $0 += 1 }
```
